# nPose-Facial-Layering-Plugin
Requires
* nPose V3

Use this plugin if Layering another animation on top of an existing pose is required. There are two types of layering animations to consider:
1. Facial animations which could include Bento joint animations.  
  This type of layering utilizes a built in looping within the scripts.  
  This type of layering is associated with a single pose in a single seat, meaning the animation will be removed when a pose is changed for this particular seat.

2. Simply called Layering animations which could include a full animation or partial animation.  
  This type of layering does not automatically loop and will only loop if the animation is uploaded to SL as a looping one. Layering can also be used for Bento animations not intended to loop.  
  This type of layering is associated with a seat however not with any specific pose.  
  This type of layering must be specifically turned off by instructions.  
  Access layering via LINKMSG or SATMSG/NOTSATMSG.
